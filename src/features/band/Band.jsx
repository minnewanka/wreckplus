          1974, in the very depth of europe, four individuals discovered the roar that produced a
          succession of transistors and tubes once connected to a magical instrument… it was loud,
          sensual and chaotic. In excess for sure. They disappeared in the most bizarre
          circumstances and nobody every heard of them since then. In 2009, a group of the same
          number of individuals claims it escaped from a dark and secret cryonics project. Awakened
          in ivry sur seine, france, they intend to continue the story where it was stopped. This
          declaration, if not a vengeance, wreck plus delivers it in an old school heavy metal
          fashion, through innovative songs where the riff is king. Every song has an identify of
          its own and a memorable atmosphere. All together this forms a tribute to black sabbath,
          judas priest, kiss, zz top and blue oÿster cult…
